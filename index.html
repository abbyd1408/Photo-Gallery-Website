							<h2>A picture of the sun peaking through the leaves</h2>
							<p>This is my favorite out of all the shots I took. I wanted to highlight the beauty of the fall colors while lettiing the sun shine through.</p>

							<h2>Some Students feeding some ducks</h2>
							<p>I thought this was a cute picture. It just shows some students feeding ducks at the duck pond. It's a very natural shot, everything is in the moment, and overall I think its just really darn cute.</p>

							<h2>A student walking towards her peers</h2>
							<p>This is a picture of a student walking towards her peers. I got down in the grass for this shot- it took a couple tries but I finally got the picture I wanted. I wanted to have the blurred out grass help frame the picture. I felt like a real photographer!</p>

							<h2>Students on the Drillfield</h2>
							<p>Here are some more pictures of students on the drillfield! I wanted to use the rule of thirds to capture this picture. Again, it feels very natural and fits well side by side with the previous picture.</p>

							<h2>A memorial for one of those lost during the Virginia Tech shooting</h2>
							<p>When finding inspiration for pictures, I wanted to show something about Tech that wouldn't first come to mind when thinking about Tech. So I went to the Memorial site infornt of Burrus Hall. I again used the rule of thirds to take this picture. </p>

							<h2>A memorial for the Survivors of the Virginia Tech shooting</h2>
							<p>As I try to honor the victims of the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, I also wanted to honor the survivors. I just wish that car hadn't been in the back of the shot!</p>

							<h2>A picture of changing leaves</h2>
							<p>I thought the leaves on this tree were so pretty! I took this picture using the rule of thirds (i really like the rule of thirds) I like how the pictures framed, and overall find it very visually pleasing.</p>

							<h2>A leading eye shot</h2>
							<p>This shot is hard to explain, but interesting. I don't really know what inspired me to taket this shot, but i just decided to get down and take it. Theres no real subject, I just think it's an interesting picture.</p>

							<h2>A picture of some flowers</h2>
							<p>I tried to take a picture of the big VT sign infront of Torgerson Bridge, but it didn't turn out well. I decided then to focus on the flowers! These flowers demonstrate really great contrast, and make the picture pop.</p>

							<h2>TA picture of Burrus Hall/h2>
							<p>For this picture I used focal point. I knew to avoid the Pylons and Torgerson Bridge, but I wanted to give tribute to Burrus Hall. I really like how the tree frames the picture.</p>

							<h2>Another tree picture!</h2>
							<p>More trees! (I also really like trees) I think the trees on the  drillfield are beautiful, especially in the fall. I wanted to depict the beauty of the leaves, and pay tribute to the Maroon and Orange: Hokie colors!</p>
